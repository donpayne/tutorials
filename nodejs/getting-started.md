## Creating a GitHub Account
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.  Signup for an account at [https://github.com](https://github.com).

Select a plan, you can start with a free plan where everything you post is public.

Select whatever you want to let the makers of GitHub know who you are to complete the signup.

At this point your account is setup.  You will likely need to confirm your email address by clicking on the link in the email that GitHub just sent to you.  Then you can create your first project repository.

Decided what to name your first repository.  You can change this later if you like, but it is a good idea to figure out a permanent name now so that people who want to use your code won't get hosed if you change the url on them.  Let GitHub create a README.md file for you.  This will just contain the title of your new repository and act as a splash page for your repository for people that navigate to your project.

Congratulations!  You are now the proud owner of a new GitHub repository.

Before we move on I would like to point out that you can use Git (the actual version control system that GitHub is built on) to clone your repository down onto your local machine with this url.  I'll talk about how to setup your SSH Keys later so that you can push changes up to your GitHub repository in a secure manner without ever having to login again.
