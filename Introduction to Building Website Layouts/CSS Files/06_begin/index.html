The Blue Leopard
A Classic Pub with a Modern Approach
The Blue Leopard is the place to come for a relaxed pub atmosphere with modern decor. Our drinks list that boasts a large range of European lagers and a superb wine selection. We've been informed that our attic is haunted so in honor of our supernatural guests, we have a Watch Party every Saturday night from 7pm until close. Live music seven nights a week, and never a cover charge for entry.

Always prepared daily from fresh ingredients, you won't be disappointed by our simple but delicious selection of pub fare.
